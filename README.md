# GenericSet

Generic Set is the templated implementation for a set of items. The class contains some custom exceptions in case of errors during insertion or deletion of items and also exposes constant random access iterators for operations that require them. 


FilterOut implements a filter method which applies a filter predicate to a Generic Set and returns a new Generic Set which contains only the elements that satisfy the predicate.
